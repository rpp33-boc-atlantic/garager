/* This is an example file for where we can put the MODELS functions for our particular feature. The code below is just an example and will be different for each feature!

file naming example: accounts.models.js, postItem.models.js (you can name it as you wish)

module.exports = {
  example: {
    get: (itemId, callback) => {
      // get stuff from database
      callback(databaseStuff);
    },
  },
};
